# Hoxen-Gaming
Introduction
The aim of this project was to demonstrate the skills learned throughout the semester through the development of a website. This particular project aims at the development of the online version of a video game store through which the users can purchase the offered games. This project displays everything that a video game enthusiast would need in a routine purchase of a particular game. 
Work philosophy
The first step into developing this project was surfing the web and various game stores applications  for inspiration. The following phase required planning of the flow of the website (which link redirects where, the best arrangement for the elements to be displayed etc). During this phase various decisions were made, such as: the color scheme for the website and the focus on animations. 
A Map to “Hoxen Gaming”
Home Page- displays a slideshow of advertisements for each of the featured games. It also serves as a connecting hub between all the other pages. The redirections are divided into 3 groups. 
The Top navigation Bar that redirects users to other parts of the website (these are mainly for displaying purposes and do not contain much interaction with the user)
The left side Navigation menu that has various information about the staff and also deals with user experience
The right side minimized game gallery which redirects the user into a series of pages each displaying in depth information about each featured game as well as the shopping options
Catalog - here the user can see all the games in the store grouped into three main categories in best sellers, most downloaded and top rated. The top games in each category are displayed in the head of each sector
About - here the user is supposed to receive information about the developer 
Contact Us - here the user can find various communication channels, a map showcasing physical locations (currently empty as the store is yet to be built) and some information in regards to rules that the user needs to keep in mind such as possible busy hours, language of communication etc.
Open Hours - shows the hours during which the shops are open. This also gives information about the shop’s availability during holidays
Our Crew - This sector is supposed to familiarize the user with the staff of the store
Reviews -  This section shows some of the od reviews left from previous users
Review Form  - IN this section the user can find a form to leave his/her own review

Featured games (on the right side of the home page): Each of these windows sends the user to a window with detailed information on each game as well as a shopping cart with the needed information for the user to  make a purchase. These game pages are connected with each other and the user can navigate through them without needing to go back to the main page

In the user needs to go back to the main page they can click on home option in the top navigation bar or in the “Hoxen gaming” logo in the top left corner of the screen

Suggestion for Development
The website is ofcourse in its infancy and this means that there is a lot of space for improvement. Technical-wise the website can introduce more interaction with the user in every one of its sectors as opposed to interaction in only some of them.
Behind the scenes the website can be connected with various databases to hold user reviews, or user orders etc.
On the practical side the website can use more games, as due to time limitations this project was limited to featuring only 5 games without providing much information on the others.
